# Phase 2 Report

## Review of Business Questions
## Data Processing
The original dataset mentioned in Phase 1 turned out to be too big to run on the local. Also, we failed to find a low-cost way to translate ```.pst``` to common files. Therefore, we chose the alternative [Enron dataset](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/), which contains plain text of translated ```.pst``` data, to continue our analysis.

In this dataset, each employee has a folder for s/heself. Each folder contains several sub-folders, including ```all_documents```, ```contacts```, ```deleted_items```, ```sent```, ```inbox```
